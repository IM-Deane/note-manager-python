# Project: Note Manager (Flask)

**Current Version 1.0.0:**

## Description

This application allows users to create simple textual notes that are then saved
into an sql database.

Before they can use the manager, the user must first register an account. After
their account has been created, the user can utilize the note manager to create,
update, and delete notes.

The main purpose of this project was to learn how to create a full-stack web app
with Python/Flask as the backend.

In the future, I mean add a prettier UI and additional features. For the moment,
I'm satisfied with the current implementation.

### Stack

- Python 3.9.7 and the
  [Flask framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- HTML template engine
  [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/)
- CSS
  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
